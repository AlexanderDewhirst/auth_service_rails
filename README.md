# Auth Service

This microservice implements a token and session based authentication system. This is a Rails API using `jwt` and `devise`. 

RFC 7519 documents the use of JWTs and expectations for the payload: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the project.

Assuming you have PostgreSQL installed and Rails and Ruby installed, preferably with a version manager, execute the following
```
gem install bundler
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
bundle install
```

From here, you should be able to start a server (`rails server`) or access the console (`rails console`)

## Testing

The Postman Workspace can be found here: https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=1e2b58da56dd3804430ed1f96e165fd5

Clone the repository and spin up a server in your shell using `rails server`. From here, we can hit the API endpoints through Postman or some other method. Each request does create a user and you may need to delete local users to successfully run tests.


## Performance Testing

Postman allows you to performance test your API with tests. 

### Register 

I have run a performance test for the registrations endpoint, `POST /api`, with 1000 interations. This performance test is a request in Postman called `Register (performance test)` and has the following performance,
```
50 percentile response time 345 is lower than 1000, the number of iterations is 1000
90 percentile response time 432 is lower than 1000, the number of iterations is 1000
```

### Login

I have run a performance test for the sessions endpoint, `POST /api/login`, with 1000 interations. This performance test is a request in Postman called `Login (performance test)` and has the following performance,
```
50 percentile response time 291 is lower than 1000, the number of iterations is 1000
90 percentile response time 363.1 is lower than 1000, the number of iterations is 1000
```

## Actions

The following actions are currently supported,
- validate `POST /api/validate`
- register `POST /api/register`
- login `POST /api/login`
- logout `DELETE /api/logout` (may deprecate due to use-case)
- blacklist JWT token `POST /api/blacklist`
- refresh JWT token `POST /api/refresh`


### Features

This API supports capability for admins to block user JWT tokens. This API also supports refresh tokens to automatically reauthenticate the current user.
